## Population Scale Analysis

# **Q13**

**Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes**

First we need to read the data provided
```{r}
url <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_W19/class-material/rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt"
data <- read.table(url)
head(data)
```


```{r}
table(data$geno)
```

# **Q14**
**Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(geno, exp, fill=geno)) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
